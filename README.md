## üß† The Science Behind Auto-Cat

## üîß How Auto-Cat Works

Auto-Cat is designed to work with CSV files, making it compatible with a wide range of data sources. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **File Input**: Start by providing a CSV file containing your unstructured data.

2. **Column Selection**: Auto-Cat displays all available columns from your CSV. You choose which columns to include in the analysis, giving you control over the categorization process.

3. **Embedding Generation**: The selected text data is transformed into high-dimensional vector representations using state-of-the-art language models. This step captures the semantic meaning of your data.

4. **Clustering Algorithms**: Auto-Cat applies multiple clustering algorithms (KMeans, DBSCAN, and Agglomerative Clustering) to these embeddings, each offering a unique perspective on your data's structure.

5. **Analysis and Visualization**: The results are analyzed and visualized through various methods, including dendrograms, word clouds, and heatmaps, providing you with comprehensive insights.

## üß† Under the Hood

Auto-Cat leverages several sophisticated techniques to deliver accurate and meaningful categorizations:

- **Data Preprocessing**: The `data_ingestion.py` module handles data cleaning, removing duplicates, and preparing text for analysis.

- **Embedding Generation**: Using the `embedding_generation.py` module, Auto-Cat employs advanced NLP models (like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large) to convert text into dense vector representations.

- **Multi-Algorithm Approach**: The `clustering.py` module implements KMeans, DBSCAN, and Agglomerative Clustering, allowing for comparison and validation of categorization results.

- **Category Analysis**: The `category_analysis.py` module extracts meaningful insights from each cluster, identifying common words and representative items.

- **Visualization**: The `reporting.py` module and the accompanying Jupyter notebook create a variety of visualizations to help you understand and interpret the results.

## üìä Dive Deeper with Our Jupyter Notebook

For data enthusiasts, we've included a Jupyter notebook (`reporting_notebook.ipynb`) that takes your analysis to the next level. It's packed with advanced visualizations and statistical analyses to give you a comprehensive understanding of your categorized data.

The included capabilities are:

- Generate detailed dendrograms with labeled nodes
- Create word clouds for each clustering method
- Produce heatmaps showing relationships between categories and common words
- Compare the performance of different clustering algorithms
- Analyze the distribution of category sizes
